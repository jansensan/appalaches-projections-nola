Appalaches - Nola Projection
============================

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/jansensan/appalaches-projections-nola/master/assets/paterson-davey-jones-locker.jpg)

A while ago, [James Paterson](http://www.presstube.com/) asked if people were interested in using [his art](http://youtu.be/Rn3526TC8LM) in another context.

I'm a guitarist for the band [Appalaches](http://appalachesmtl.com/). Our song song [Nola](https://soundcloud.com/appalachesmtl/nola) has the same duration as James's video. I tried putting out music to the video and it fitted perfectly!

With James's accord, I will create an interactive/active version of his animation which is going to be used as a video projection during the live performance for the song Nola. The code and the assets for this project will be available in this repository.
